> Collect and Analyze Individual Contributor Pull Requests

`prfiesta` allows you to collect, analyze and celebrate pull requests made by an individual ðŸŽ‰.

It can be used by engineers or managers to gain insights into all the great work the contributor has made over a specified period of time. A great use case of this tool is during a performance review process when you want to perform analysis on all the contributions made over the year.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install prfiesta
```

Dependencies:

- Python 3.8+

## Usage

```bash
# Authenticate yourself
export GITHUB_TOKEN=... # or GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN

# Get all pull requests for a user
prfiesta -u kiran94

# Get all pull requests for a user created after a date
prfiesta -u kiran94 --after 2023-01-01

# Get all pull requests for a user created between two dates
prfiesta -u kiran94 --after 2023-01-01 --before 2023-06-01

# Get all pull requests for a user updated after a date
prfiesta -u kiran94 --after 2023-01-01 --use_updated

# Get all pull requests with a custom output file name
prfiesta -u kiran94 --output my_pull_requests.csv

# Get all pull requests in parquet format with a custom file name
prfiesta -u kiran94 --output_type parquet --output my_pull_requests.parquet

# Get all pull requests for more then one user
prfiesta -u kiran94 -u user2

# Get all pull requests and drop specific columns from the output
prfiesta -u kiran94 -dc events_url -dc comments_url -dc node_id

# Get help
prfiesta --help
```

You can also leverage `prfiesta` directly in your own application:

```python
import pandas as pd

from datetime import datetime
from prfiesta.collectors.github import GitHubCollector

github = GitHubCollector()
frame: pd.DataFrame = github.collect('kiran94', 'user2', after=datetime(2023, 1, 1))

print(frame)
```

### Output

You can control the output type using the `--output_type` option. Supported options:

- `csv` (default)
- `parquet`

You can also customize the output file name using the `--output` option.

### Date Filter

When using the `--after` and `--before` date filters, by default `prfiesta` will use the `created` date dimension with these filters on the Git provider (e.g GitHub). This may not fit your use case and you may want to filter on when a pull request was updated instead. To do this you can use the `--use_updated` flag.

See more information [here](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-when-an-issue-or-pull-request-was-created-or-last-updated).

## Analysis

`prfiesta` ships with built in plots to help analyze your pull request data. These serve as a starting point in your analysis. See more information on the build in plots and views [here](https://github.com/kiran94/prfiesta/blob/main/docs/analysis.md).

## Using GitHub Enterprise

If you trying to fetch data from a [GitHub Enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/enterprise-admin?apiVersion=2022-11-28) server, then much of the same functionality should work the same. You just need to make sure that:

- `GH_HOST` is set to your enterprise instance's API URL. Reach out to your internal GitHub team if you are not sure what this should be.
- `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) generated on your GitHub Enterprise instance.

## GitHub Rate Limiting

Depending on your input parameters, you may end up in a situation where you are being [Rate Limited](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#rate-limiting) by the GitHub API.

See this [Notebook](https://github.com/kiran94/prfiesta/blob/main/notebooks/misc/rate_limit.ipynb) on a way to handle this.

| `LOGGING_LEVEL`           | The [Logging Level](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels) to use                                                    | `INFO`                   |

## Developer Setup

Assuming you have cloned the repository and are at the root of the repository in your terminal.

```bash
poetry shell
poetry install
poetry build
```

This should leave you in a state where you have the virtual environment sourced, all dependencies are installed and `prfiesta` is installed locally.

You can then leverage the various commands in the [makefile](https://github.com/kiran94/prfiesta/blob/main/makefile) for development tasks:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
make test

# Produce code coverage reports
make coverage

# Code linting
make lint
```

Optionally you can also install [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) to run some sanity checks before your commits.

```bash
# Install it into your git hooks (one time setup)
# from this point onwards, any commits will run pre-commit checks
precommit_install

# If you want to run all checks on all files without comitting.
precommit_run
```

### Creating Prereleases

When you create a pull request on this repository, various CI checks are run, towards the end of those checks there is a `release` job.

Usually when running under `main`, this job is responsible for publishing new versions to the pypi. However when running under a pull request, this will create a special prerelease package specific to that pull reuqest.

The versioning of this package follows [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#pre-releases) and will look something like this:

```
0.8.1b125
```

Where
- `0.8.1` = The bumped version of what is currently within the `pyproject.toml` of that pull request. We don't attempt to do any analysis to figure out if we should be bumping with a higher serverity in this context.
- `b` = Beta; Indicates to pypi that this is a prerelease package.
- `125` = The `github.run_number` from [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context).

An example prerelease package looks like this: https://pypi.org/project/prfiesta/0.8.1b125/

Downstream users can then do a full end to end test with the prerelease package before the change is merged into `main`.

# Analysis

prfiesta ships with built in plots to help analyze your pull request data. These serve as a starting point in your analysis.

**It's recommended to run these within the context of a [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/)**

## Built In Views

| View                                       | Description                                                                                                                  | Sample                                              |

All prfiesta plots have the same signature:

```python
def plot_NAME(data: pd.DataFrame, **kwargs) -> Union[plt.Figure, plt.Axes]:
    ...
```

*Where `NAME` is the placeholder for the actual plot name.*

- The plotting functions always take a `pd.DataFrame` as the first argument. This Dataframe should originate from the prfiesta collection process.
- The plotting functions always return something which can be displayed in a Jupyter Notebook
- The plotting functions always take `**kwargs` which can be used to further customize the output
    - The exact specifics of this is up to the plotting function however in general the following common *optional* options should exist:

| Option           | Type                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------                  | ---------------                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `ax`             | `Optional[matplotlib.axes.Axes]` | The `matplotlib` axis to plot into. This allows users to add the plot into a `plt.subplots`. If omitted, the plot will just plot into the default location                                     |
| `palette`        | `Optional[str]`                  | A color palette to apply to the plot (e.g a [seaborn color palette](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html))                                                                  |
| `title`          | `Optional[str]`                  | The title of the plot                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `hue`            | `Optional[str]`                  | Used to distinguise different catagories. This is relevant to [seaborn backed plots](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html?highlight=hue#vary-hue-to-distinguish-categories) |


## Building a Custom Plot

You can build your own plot by creating a function that follows this signature:

```python
from typing import Union
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_my_cool_plot(data: pd.DataFrame, **kwargs) -> Union[plt.Figure, plt.Axes, pd.DataFrame]:
    pass
```

All prfiesta should accept the same `kwargs` mentioned in the above table however implementation of these `kwargs` per plot is on a best effort basis.

**If you build a plot which you think will be useful for others then feel free to contribute it to this project ðŸš€**
